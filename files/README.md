# files
You can find files useful for running the ML-aided workflows here.

## 1-data-generation
This folder contains the scripts used to generate the ground truth data for training our ML model.

## 2-coarsening
These scripts sample the fine grained ground truth generated in step 1 and produce the coarse grained ground truth.

## 3-coarse_simulations
This generates a simulated timestep from each ground truth timestep.

## 4-training-data
This folder contains the post-processing script that gathers the training data for the model.

## 5-training
This folder contains files related to the ML model -- its architecture and training pipeline.

## 6-simulation
We demonstrate the workflow on the Hasegawa-Wakatani equations.

## 7-visualisation
This python notebook visualises the simulation data generated by the workflow.

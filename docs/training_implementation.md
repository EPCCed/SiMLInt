# ML Model Training

Following on from the [data generation phase](data-generation.md) of our implementation for the Hasegawa-Wakatani example, this page describes how we train our ML models.

1. Error calculation.

    We are at the stage of having fine-grained simulation trajectories, and from those, extracted data for each timestep, coarsened that data, and run single-timestep coarse-grained simulations.

    Now, the task is to take the difference between timestep 1 and timestep 0 of those coarse-grained simulations.
